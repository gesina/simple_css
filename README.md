# Simple CSS
This is a minimalistic style sheet to be applied to simple text
homepages with focus on typographic standards, especially readability.
It is heavily based on Marc Busqu√©'s
[gutenweb stylesheet][https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/gutenweb/].
The major new feature is a responsive style for the navigation bar
such that it hides on small devices.
